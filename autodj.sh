# This script reads a song name from standard input, searches for it on YouTube, downloads only the audio from the
# first result and adds it to the AutoDJ queue in Mixxx.
#
# The script relies on hard-coded coordinates on which it clicks. You must configure these coordinates
# based on your monitor. Obviously changing the window size of Mixxx in any way will interfere with the correct
# operation of this script. It is recomended to leave Mixxx in fullscreen on the primary display.
#
# It is recommended to clear the AutoDJ queue after starting the script. Add at least two songs before starting
# the AutoDJ function in Mixxx to avoid playing the first song twice. 
#
# Known issues:
# -very long song names that only differ in the last parts of their names can be mistaken for each other
#
# Version 1.0 uses VLC instead of Mixxx and is simpler, more reliable and more lightweight. However, VLC does not
# support crossfading between songs and doesn't have the AutoDJ functionality that Mixxx has.

# Set the directory where AutoDJ will download all songs. It must be the Mixxx library or preferably a folder in it.
# No trailing slash!

# Unicode symbols in video titles are escaped as bytes which are represented with \x notation
# For example the cyrilic letter "Ð©" (sht) becomes "\xd0\xa9" - 8 bytes in total
# The maximum filename lenght on most filesystems, including ext4, is 255 bytes
# The filename during download ends in .webm.part (10 bytes) and \0 (I think?)
# This suggests that the maximum title lenght if only cyrillic letters are used is (255 - 11) / 8 = 30
# In practice the script works fine with titles that include 50+ cyrilic letters but breaks somewhere around 60.
# Needs more testing
# So basically, I got annoyed by this ungodly crap and eyeballed the lenght limit.
